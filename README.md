This course provides an advanced overview of Health Informatics and is meant to appeal to any Georgetown HIDS candidate as a core course.  Given the generally high level of Health Informatics field and its important role in the healthcare delivery, it is likely that each of you will have (or may already have had) some notion about informatics, information technologies at some point in your careers.  This course will provide you with a framework to help you advance your understanding of the informatics environment in healthcare, to assess different components of the ecosystem, to develop understanding about each of the major building blocks, and to be able to complete the settings and requirements of technologies enabling health information access, sharing and analysis to improve performance, efficiency and enable a better patient outcome.  This course also provides an understanding of the leadership role in the selection, implementation and management of technologies including computer based decision models to structure information and analyze complex organizational problems. Current and emerging IT applications and technologies such as mobile health, and telemedicine will be analyzed for their influence on cost, quality and access to care; the legal, ethical and regulatory ramifications of these technological advances will also be explored.
